# Team Contract


# Mason Mason
I will be taking the responsibilities of Task Manager and Unit Tester. As the task manager, I will be keeping our issues page updated with any adjustments I may find that our app may need. I will also try to dish out responsibilities equitably according to the responsibilities that we have signed on for here. As the unit tester I will be creating tests using our code to make sure everything is working properly.

# Ethan Thomas

I am taking on the Integration Tester and lead Alpha/Beta Tester for the project, that being said I am more than willing to support other roles as the project requires it. Within these roles, I will be the head of developing backend programming and developing the backbone of the app as well as attaching it to the database API. Outside of these tasks, I will provide assistance to anyone in need of support and provide active lines of communication to team members and clients as needed.
