# Team Contract


# Mason Mason
I will be taking the responsibilities of Task Manager and Unit Tester. As the task manager, I will be keeping our issues page updated with any adjustments I may find that our app may need. I will also try to dish out responsibilities equitably according to the responsibilities that we have signed on for here. As the unit tester I will be creating tests using our code to make sure everything is working properly.

# Ethan Thomas

I am taking on the Integration Tester and lead Alpha/Beta Tester for the project, that being said I am more than willing to support other roles as the project requires it. Within these roles, I will be the head of developing backend programming and developing the backbone of the app as well as attaching it to the database API. Outside of these tasks, I will provide assistance to anyone in need of support and provide active lines of communication to team members and clients as needed.

# Olivia Larson 
I am working with Ethan and helping with the Integration Testing and Alpha/Beta Testing as well. This means I will be doing a lot of the backend coding and making sure the app is doing what it is supposecd to do. My biggest goal for this project is to be available to meet and get work done with my team. Working together to figure out tough bit of code makes it more managable. #team work makes the dream work

# Sarah Wright
I will be working mostly on the GUI and communicating with the client and potentially helping with the integration as things change and evolve through the project and the GUI. Within these roles, my primary goals will be to keep up an efficient stream of communication between my team members and the clients as well as making the GUI visually appealing while interacting with the background processes.
