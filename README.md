# Final Contract





## Ethan Thomas

I am taking on the Integration Tester and lead Alpha/Beta Tester for the project, that being said I am more than willing to support other roles as the project requires it. Within these roles, I will be the head of developing backend programming and developing the backbone of the app as well as attaching it to the database API. Outside of these tasks, I will provide assistance to anyone in need of support and provide active lines of communication to team members and clients as needed.   

By making changes to this document I, Ethan Thomas, certify my contributions and commitment to this project.
